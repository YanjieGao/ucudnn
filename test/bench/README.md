The CSV files in this directory are lists of parameters of convolutional layers frequently used in CNNs.

* `deepbench_conv_train.csv`: This comes from [Baidu DeepBench](https://github.com/baidu-research/DeepBench) (as of [9ab7a74](https://github.com/baidu-research/DeepBench/blob/9ab7a74f449e873020d04f3c0a75ed31127c9c38/DeepBenchKernels_train.xlsx)).
* `deepbench_conv_train_n4x.csv`: The same parameters as `deepbench_conv_train.csv`, but *N* (mini-batch size) is multipled by 4.
* `alexnet.csv`: The parameters of AlexNet \[1\].
